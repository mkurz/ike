PLATFORM NOTES
--------------

The only platforms that have been tested at present are FreeBSD i386 and
amd64. This software also compiles on NetBSD but does not work as there
are threading issues. For FreeBSD amd64 builds, you must first specify
the -fPIC compiler option in the C_FLAGS environment variable before
attempting to compile. For example, from a bash shell you enter the
following command ...

export C_FLAGS=-fPIC

COMPILING
---------

The build system is very basic at the moment. The make files use BSD style
rules so the project will need to be re-tooled before it will build on
other platforms. The root make file is located in the unix directory. To
build and install the ike daemon, enter the following commands using the
root login ...

cd unix
make
make install

OPTIONS
-------

A few build options may be specified. Here is a brief list ...

DEBUG	preserve debug symbols
NATT	enable natt support ( requires kernel support )
LDAP	enable ldap support ( requires openldap client )

For example, to build iked with all options, you would specify ...

cd unix
make -DDEBUG -DNATT -DLDAP
make install

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This software requires Bison version 2.3 or higher as it uses the new
c++ parser model. The c++ model was introduced in 2.1 but appears to
be broken in that release.
