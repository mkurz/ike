The build system is very basic at the moment. The make files use BSD style
rules so the project will need to be autotooled before it will build on
other platforms. The root make file is located in the unix directory. To
build and install the ike daemon, enter the following commands using the
root login ...

cd unix
make
make install

You can also specify a few build options. Here is a brief list ...

DEBUG	preserve debug symbols
NATT	enable natt support ( requires kernel support )
LDAP	enable ldap support ( requires openldap client )

To build iked with all options, you would specify ...

cd unix
make -DDEBUG -DNATT -DLDAP
make install

This software does require Bison version 2.3 or higher as it uses the new
c++ parser model.
